       Nishchal had started Preseed to take a form of an earliest stage tech incubator, that has mastered the art of inspiring MVPs with little to no money, starting with his own 2 startups mentioned above, in Social Networking and Math.

              <summary>Other Preseed Startups (through TSF)</summary>
              <div class="faq__content"style="color: #000; font-size: 16px;">
        <p><small>On the above section on our homepage, we will list only those startups which are built by Nishchal & team out of Nishchal's own itch and fundamental ideas. Preseed has been essentially built as a machine where Nishchal can float such lofty ideas and see them take shape. 
		Basically, startups born in Preseed out of its first purpose of assisting Nishchal's lofty goals, are Preseed homepage-worthy startups, directly and by default, for they are what is inseparable from the brand of Preseed. In fact, it is the story of Preseed that is giving birth to them.</p>

		      <p></i> Furthermore, the relevance of making Preseed's home page around only Nishchal's startups ensures - Preseed must and will first only represent that which it was started to do - which is, assisting in the creation of Nishchal's own startup MVPs, above all else. 
			  For, in Nishchal's altruism we trust the most. We trust that he will make it for only altruisitic reasons, both startups, and money. For him, altruism is not a cliche from the world of righteousness. It is a real state of heart for some. The fewest in the world is this breed.</i></p>
  		      
<p>  For all other startups in the world, interested in us - TSF is an independent investment facilitation unit of Preseed that may or may not have the same terms as Preseed. 
	Our financial expert and investment advisor, Kartik, decides those terms based on each independent case at TSF. He will get in touch with you after you apply in TSF.</small></p>

	   So, Preseed is being made available through its investment banking team and its <a style="background-color:none;color:rgb(237, 66, 66);text-decoration: none;cursor:normal;">upcoming startup fund, TSF (The Simple Fund)</a>, for you and your startups, shortly. </p>

        swayed, infirm (but, only conviniently firm about dogmas and easily sold to money to comprimise on dogmas, simultaneusly, दोग़ला/double faced), corrupt, lazy, dumb, obstructive, evil, dramatic, passive, aggressive and bitter forces did that person
        righteously piss off to hold his culture's values intact regardless of the costs. <br><br>
		  
		  In case of Nishchal we can safely say, many, and still counting. He bets, the same people who he may have piseed off may still have grand words for him if they speak from their silent core. Why? For, only truth he revered. We are not talking about ordinary kind of pissing of with one's audacity. We
        are
        talking about, pissing off the wrong one pointing the gun on you, kind of pissing off. Why? Because in law of
        the land
        he trusts. 
		  <br><br>
		  So, we will bow down to nothing, no one, except the law of the land. For the culture at Preseed,
        Nishchal will ensure is the culture of truth and fearlessness.  Culture is everything. Our culture is about technological research and development, above all else that you will find here.
        <br><br>
        
        Our app called  <a href="https://chattodo.preseed.in/">Chattodo/कार्यकरता</a> is our next step for you. It is here that that our party members will communicate and collaborate with each other to craft our vision of India. Our party Chatbot will take your onboarding forward. To know about Chattodo and its vision, <a href="https://chattodo.preseed.in/vision/" target="_blank">visit its full vision on chattodo.preseed.in/vision.</a><a href="https://chattodo.preseed.in/vision/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/SS.jpg" alt="" class="img img-responsive"></a>
        <p>We want to give greater freedom to humans in order to make a few among them, a new breed of conscientious humans. We believe that the right time has come to fulfill our goal and this is also the right time for political will to join that same entrepreneurial goal. For, we are first building this app to launch our founder, Nishchal's own political movement. His party may become the first political party in the world to have its 'own' communication app. RSS can continue on whatsapp while Nishchal's party will build its members force on Chattodo.
        <br><br>
	We are ensuring for us, that we have a role to play in the election of the future prime minister of India, by way of the questions we will ask, and the answers we will revceive from what will be know as the Preseed team. May the best human win! Whether from the Preseed team or not, is secondary for us. So, the establishment will always be asked questions and/or shown pathways by way of our prototypes. We invite them to do what we are doing, for the sake of our country, BHARAT, that is India. And, if they do, our goal would be achieved!

<p> We hope you can see why we have designed our organisation towards public support far more than VC investments. So, we may fail in excercising the liberties that come with public support and love just like any other potential citizens movement would in a democracy, if you do not pay attention to us, with trust in the world of mistrust.

         <!--<p>  NOTE: The founder is the company's culture and manifesto first. If you know our founder, you know what can happen in favour of India if he is successful in building this incubator, Preseed, exactly as envisioned. Although, the truth is, life is a matter of cosmic waves, larager than oceanic waves. So it is what happens when we are busy making other plans. Often the plans we make that work out, are infact the plans that got made out of a non work state of mind. Anyway, if we digress in the direction of the last statement, you will have to know from Nishchal, directly, what is all we humans have the free will for then, if outcomes are already written by 'GOD', <i>which is not even there</i>. WOAH! Not even there. WTF? Anyway, let us get back to work for now. So, he has given Preseed its action, altruism, unwavering will, two portfolio startups, space and culture. 
He is shouldering the responsibility from the front of bringing about the changes in the world reflecting from, the Preseed Home Page Startups, Preseed website words and permanent workation culture at Preseed. Join us on this mission dear lovers, friends and foes. For this is a mission about your own country and your global fellow beings.

                    <div class="faq__content">
                  
                      <h2 style="color: #000;"><b>Karma:</b></h2>
                      <p style="color: #000;">Karma means action; an action can either bind or liberate you. If
                        action
                        is in pursuit of happiness, it binds and if it is an expression of
                        happiness it
                        liberates.
                        Only if your action is an expression of your joy it is worthwhile
                        otherwise it
                        is just
                        an
                        exploitation.</p>
                  
                 <h2 style="color: #000;">     <b>Dharma:</b></h2>
                      <p style="color: #000;">There are certain rhythm which governs the functioning of life and
                        existence. These rhythm can be called as laws or Dharma. Dharma
                        exist at every
                        sphere of
                        life. If an action or Karma follows the appropriate rhythm or Dharma
                        then it is
                        correct
                        in
                        existential terms otherwise it is destructive.</p>
                  
                 <h2 style="color: #000;">    <b>Sewa:</b></h2>
                      <p style="color: #000;">Being available is seva. Like the Sun, the wind, fruits etc. The most
                        fundamental law or Dharma of existence is Seva. Seva appropriates
                        life and gives
                        a
                        meaning
                        to it.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                      <br>
                  
                      <br>
                      <p align="center">

                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p style="color: #000;">When Karma, Dharma and Seva fall in the same line then the
                        whole effort
                        is
                        called as Karma yoga. At some point the whole economics of India
                        was
                        designed on
                        this line and evidence proves that it was the most successful and
                        holistic.

                         <br>I
                         and what am I here to do for you, I expect you to do the same.</strong><br><br>
                   
                   
                       We don’t do physical meetings unless:<br></br>
                       1. There is a signed detailed letter of intent by you indicating clearly all of what you seek from us.
                       It
                       can simply be an email to us from your highest relevant authority.<br></br>
                       2. A written acknowledgment that you have gone through our essays on Medium, linked to our services
                       listed
                       on our home page www.preseed.in.<br></br>
                       3. You have made efforts through communication with us on Whatsapp chats, voice notes, video calls,
                       and
                       emails to minimize ambiguity towards clarity of our relationship.<br></br>
                       4. You have then proceeded to talk to us over phone calls.<br></br>
                       5. You may come to the place of our being. Our office is in New Delhi and Lucknow. However, we mostly
                       work
                       from remote locations like the mountains or sometimes, the beaches. You may check with us about our
                       current
                       whereabouts, and come to meet us there instead.<br></br>
                   
                       If most of the above is done, and now there is a genuine need of a physical meeting at your place of
                       being,
                       after having used web technology for meetings and video conferencing, you may proceed to transfer the
                       amount
                       equal to the cost of a to and fro air ticket for us and a reasonable stay in your city, no less than
                       Rs.
                       25,000 in total in our bank account, per person visiting you, from our side:<br></br>

                       Once done, you may intimate us on our email with all of the above and we will proceed to book our
                       tickets
                       to
                       you shortly.<br></br>
                   
                       There’s nothing more annoying than meeting just to meet. Business meetings aren’t effective when a
                       decision
                       needs to be made or for informational purposes. You can take care of that with a simple phone call or
                       a
                       company-wide email with a plea for no reply.<br></br>
                   
                       Unless it’s a brainstorming session, a meeting should be called only to support and convey a
                       previously
                       made
                       decision. A productive business meeting produces a committed plan of action. To stay on track, curb
                       any
                       irrelevant discussions, interruptions, and repeated points.<br>
                       <br>
                       <b>Begin the meeting before it starts.</b><br><br>
                       “Prepare people ahead of time so you are all on the same page when you enter the room,” Wrike founder
                       Andrew
                       Filev advises. “Create notes and an agenda in advance and — here’s the tricky part — actually review
                       them
                       before the meeting starts.”<br><br>
                   
                       He also recommends putting key information someplace where participants can see it and discuss it in a
                       running thread well before the actual meeting. “That way, the meeting is focused on solving problems
                       and
                       not
                       just describing them,” he says. “The first 10 minutes of your meeting shouldn’t be a discussion of why
                       you’re meeting.”<br><br>
                   
                       This essay is just our attempt to ensure the meeting or series of meetings during our physical
                       presence
                       with
                       you are fruitful.<br></br>
                   
                       <b>Note -:</b> We detest the idea of meetings when there are more than 5 participants and ambiguous
                       reasons
                       for the presence of 5. We don’t however mind numerous silent observers.
                       <br><br>
                       If you have any doubt about our understandings of efficient meetings, google “meetings are
                       inefficient”
                       or
                       “meetings kill productivity” etc. Having said that, we don’t mean that this is always true. However,
                       it
                       is
                       mostly always true when the agenda of the meeting is not clear with a defined boundary unless the
                       agenda
                       itself is — boundless brainstorming.
