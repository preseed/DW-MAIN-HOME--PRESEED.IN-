			     I don't want money for my startups. I need money to sustain, I, Steve, YT team and legal team. This is all it will take my rarest innovation ground, upon which such innovation can continue to take place, to keep alive, an India-empowering dream. Our not for profit drives our intellectual identity too. It is for this reason we will have a portfolio of startups without being a fund.
<br>
So far, so much has been done by us without any investment raises. How? I replaced money with inspiration for one and all. Our leadership replaces MONEY with INSPIRATION. Startups can also be built by organic ability to make money rather than investor's money. This is the kind of startup that we inspire our startups to become, rather than investor chasing rat race.

"Dear former volunteers at Preseed, my friends and my relatives,
			      <br><br>

Some of you have now become a fund or fund syndicate. Now, a path-breaking move in your career can occur through handshake I am offering you/your fund/ or your syndicate.
<br>
You are a bunch of very talented human beings that can mobilise money. I don't want to know more. Just knowing that much about you is enough for me. I don't have the time for the rest anyway.
<br>
I and our CTO from Russia are very busy in replacing bytes with Knytes in common computing discussions. Such is the leap we are to make. The whole world will be impacted by our fundamental meta language of everything in the digital age.
     
                        <br><br>It's important for a fund or fund syndicate looking for a path-breaking possibility to understand in the first place the very need of the path breaker for any fund to live the rare VC dream of a 100x multiplier. Full fill it now, through a handshake with us.

Your fund or fund syndicate can be the most path breaking one in India because of Preseed's fundamental works in Semantic Web.

What will we take to build this?

Financial support of my anyone to enable me and my CTO to continue to run our leadership for 5 more years. Such a timeframe is what it will take us to deliver commercial possibilities out of our research in Knowledge Engineering v/s Information engineering. Such a time frame is the usual timeframe that it takes to deliver the result of being on the cutting edge of technology as Preseed is on. These are matters of decades of R&D.

<br><br>

			      <b>Tech companies, make a note :</b>
			      <br><br>Even Mukesh Ambani's Jio may like to have our R&D. For, Anil Ambani, this could be a possibility far beyond what he may have thought of during the Zapak days of his failed internet endeavors. Any tech company, if given a chance, will benefit from such deep tech research as ours. Dig our homepage for The Metalanguage to know more.

Our R&D is once in a lifetime kind of a matter, comparable to tech revolutions of the personal computing revolution ushered in by Apple and Microsoft.

                          of our value creation potential, for the team of Nishhal and Steve are the rarest you will find.
<br><br>

			      <b>Collateral Security?</b>
<br><br>
For this this money/support from anyone to sustain two geniuses, Nishchal and Steve, with their beautiful abstractions, what security or collateral can we give? It can be seen on our homepage that our organically growing business MEL, is the only tangible asset we have with existing revenues and order pipelines. We may pledge all our stakes in MEL as security against investment for Nishchal and Steve's R&D, to anyone who supports geniunely and financially, until we return his money with a suitable multiplier in 5 years. It is at this point MEL stakes be returned to us as is. At the end of the first year itslef, the sponsorer or supporter or investor, has the choice to stop the support in case Math Ed Labs (MEL) is not growing. Why should MEL be considered? For it is our most straightforward vision for a business with real revenues. It won't take long for anyone to imagine how this business of ours can be used to return any money invested in Preseed's R&D demands for strengthening India technologically. This is friends and family round to me of 200,000 dollars at first. This is why you are finding a very personal undertone in these drafts.
<br><br>
"Can my uncle, who we feel can give 1-year of support be willing to lose this amount after having read my sheer audacious agency, to give me a chance; for me to prove that such abstractions manifest too and this time, from India? This is the question one needs to ask him. I promise after this I wouldn't need another round of funding. 200000 dollars per year is all the cost I need for Preseed to trade in billions of dollars in 5 years one day through planting seeds on the ground I have created. The next funding will be a billion dollars, creafing the N0 fund by a large tech company of the world for commercial application of the Metalanguage. Expected in 5 years.

                          arethe
                          same, but only in our absolute silence. The moment we start surfacing after
                          our
                          long silence, as individuals, we realize there is just one Sunny Kesarwani,
                          who
                          decided to say no to all opportunities where traction and team were a far
                          easier
                          find. I decided to chase a chat app instead, in spite of the world of
                          potential
                          colleagues that thought this won't work, because the world doesn't need
                          another
                          chat app. Let's understand that one of us out of millions of us can be
                          allowed
                          to break the rule of getting to an investor before traction, because he is
                          building a product that cannot come out as a MVP. Give me a minimum of

                          absolutely
                          now and let me have my team full time. In three months we will build the
                          most
                          beautiful chat app in the world. Then give us the rest of money to launch it

                          as an investor, a man whose vibe I like, we may be willing to lower the

 - Nishchal, 2024

                          <br><br>
                          In the short term, for CHattodo ad Math Ed Labs: <br> <br>
                          1. 1 year - The next round of investment our value, and hence your
                          investment’s
                          value, will be doubled with just 1000 active users for our chatapp. <br>
                          2. We can bring back to life the dying billion dollar products like
                          Evernote,
                          wunderlist (microsoft), alive if they acquire us. <br>
                          3. We have our eyes set on exploring a multi-million dollar part buy-out by
                          Angelist. <br>
                          <br>
                          Exit in the long-term for the investor - Whats App was acquired for $20
                          billion
                          in 6 years. This will be too. By who? Facebook. Why? Facebook wants to be
                          number
                          1 in work collaboration space too, which we will win.
                          Who doesn’t want to own an effective communication tool? Microsoft, Google,
                          LInkedIn to Indian - Airtel, Directi, zoho?
                          However, we desire to go the IPO way
			      <br>
			      <br>
		
			      If continued rate of growth for Math Ed Labs as is expressed on its decck, event its value will be doubled. 
			      This means, Both products have a chance to be wirth $ 5 Million each in 1 year from $2.5 milion today.

                      We have developed the prototype in 2017, and the launch version of the app in 2024. Why? Like
                          we said above - just imagine, would you have used a chatting app in 2017 which looked and feels
                          like is soliving the problem that is solved through Whatsapp, Slack, Snapchatb, FB messenger, Notes, Reminders, Trello, Linkedin collectively solved? 
	 We wlikely wouldn't have. We sensed that the problem to solve which a social network must be created in India will be the problem that the data of its own people is not with India, but with America and China. So for us to make the
                          presence of our app felt, we must move in to tap the need arrising out of this problem, and be ready to actually build
                          a finger licking beautiful product designed to make you more productive. To launch it with this optimism that it will eat up
                          some of the market share of communication away from Whatsapp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Notes etc. in India, we have struck a deal with an influential person in India's centre, already. 
                          This implies that your time must go into the broad understanding of the
                          market, vision, product, and team camaraderie first; then the questions about a world class development of the app to beat the best in the world at Social Networking, then the
                          launch of the app, and then following of metrics and somewhere along the way, dabbling
                          in projections will happen. But first, we must continue to grow organically as we have been growing, without raising any investment.

                          No traction yet for the main mobile app. 
                          Because this product is about a chatapp. Chatting apps cannot be made and launched as
                          half a baked MVP for the world
                          We needed so much time, to integrate the team in a mission oriented way by making them realise, the problem of noise of 2 decades since the beginning of Social Internet can be addressed by our Social Network at sometime within these two decades from 2009-2029.
	 Now, the team continues to build a
                          great product with some confidence in the captain, that is, I, that I will take care of
                          their long term wealth creation so long as they are aligned with my Social Networking mission. Not everyone required in this team will have the same appetite
                          for risk as I take.

                          <b>Traction we have achieved so far: </b>None. So far we were not chasing traction. We were
                          fighting personal odds and chasing a vision & design that required years of sacrifices
                          away from the norms of chasing traction common to apps with lesser time to chase vision,
                          because they are too busy chasing the incremental changes in the status quo.</i>

                            <strong> The following are the points to give you some sense of how Chattodo is operated or its modus operandi :
                                :</strong><br>
                            <br>

                            1. We run a remotely distributed team spread in America and India. This is a self motivated team, Chattodo Founder, Nishchal, has led across an organically growing relationship of 7 years now.
                           
        <br>
                            <br> 2. Promotion of our app towards a strong proof of concept or market is to be done within power centre's of India due to the business development deal we have cracked with an well extremely network man sitting in power.
                            validation.<br>
                            <br> 3. UI improvements such that the app becomes self-explanatory we have been doing with are design volunteers successfully for 7 years now. Downloacd the app and see for yourself.<br>
                            <br> 4. Social media feed system development on our app. (It already works
                            on
                            the<br>
                            current version but not to a point yet, that it can break the compulsive

                            need habit of Facebook/LinkedIn etc. for productive people, however in 4
                            months<br>
                            we will be able to achieve this for our active users).<br>
                            <br> 5. iOS will be done to near perfection this year itself. Then we will
                            be
                            ready<br>
                            for growth. <br>
                            <br>6. Investment from aligned investors with a track record in tech services
                          ,<br>
                            such that, he is not only our investor, but also the project manager for Chattodo.<br>
                            <br> 7. Only a matter of time, that this team Nishchal has assembled and replaced money with inspiration to create big outcomes, without your investment required for it.<br>
                            (We have been able to hire by inspiring so far. If we have some of your money to opeerate at will, towards any need of ours I can
                            inspire<br>
                            and manage the best talent in the world to join me. I can do this job
                            better<br>

                            <br>
                            For this I will be speaking directly with two of my good friends - YC
                            Almunus,
                            Sachin, who had also serveed as a Product manager Twitter and my former CTO, Parag, whose startup was acquired by Paytm. When that time
                            comes.
                            That is our core focused global marketing which I will do myself in Schools and Startups. Through them I
                            will
                            try to get it into the hands of the employees of those companies. I will
                            focus
                            on that. That is the kind of start I want from my own marketing time spent.

                            <br>
                            So I build the product and pitch it to employees of top companies. That will
                            be
                            the highest use case of Chattodo I want to focus on that. And just that. It
                            entails, building a great product, and then talking to great people about
                            it.

                            Also writing to best media blogs in the world about its metrics, when I have them. I want the start of
                            my
                            personal marketing effort to happen from there.
                            I will stick to what I am good at, writing, I will write a thorough article
                            about productivity and the future of roofless offices and distributed teams.
